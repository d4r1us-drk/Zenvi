#+description: Documentation document that describes the initial idea for this project

* Project Context

Zenvi is the final project for the Web Application Development course. The
choice of this project arose from the top 100 most visited websites according to
Similarweb, a recommendation from the professor to inspire us in the type of
website to develop. My choice was to create a clone of Facebook, a social
network for macroblogging and private messaging.

* Project Details

** Adaptation

To differentiate the Zenvi project from what already exists, it has been decided
to focus on the following aspects:

- **Privacy**: Zenvi will be a private and completely independent social network,
  designed to be used by closed groups such as families or friends.
- **Open Source Community**: The project will encourage participation from the
  open source community, allowing for continuous collaboration and improvements.
- **Self-Hosted Model**: Zenvi will be self-hosted, meaning each group can manage
  their own server, thereby ensuring greater control over data and privacy.

** Ideas

Zenvi will include a series of specific features to ensure its functionality and
suitability for the stated objectives.

*** Access and Administration

- **Login**: The site will only be accessible through login, emphasizing the
  privacy of the social network.
- **Account Management**: The administrator will be solely responsible for
  creating and managing server accounts. There will be no registration form
  available for users.

*** Home Page

- **Main Feed**: Similar to Facebook, the home page will display a global feed
  that includes all posts on the server. This feed will not have default
  filters, suitable for small communities. Users can follow other users and
  filter the feed to show only the posts from those they follow.

*** Main Features

Zenvi users will be able to perform the following actions:

1. *Account and User Profile Management*: Edit personal information and configure
   account preferences.
2. *View Main Feed (Home)*: Access the home page with the global or filtered feed.
3. *Private Messaging*: Send and receive private messages with other users.
4. *Chat Rooms*: Create and participate in group chat rooms.
5. *Comment on Posts*: Comment on posts with a limit of 500 characters per
   comment.
6. *Multimedia Posts*: Upload photos and videos in posts, with a limit of 10,000
   characters per post.
7. *Multimedia in Chats*: Send photos and videos through chats.
8. *Interact with Profiles*: View and follow other users' profiles.
9. *Mentions in Posts**: Mention other users in posts, notifying them of the
   mention.
10. *Notification Management*: Manage notifications including mentions in posts,
    new followers, and messages.

*** Post Metadata

Posts in Zenvi will contain the following metadata:

1. *Publication Date*: Record of the date and time the post was made.
2. *Modification Date*: If the post was edited, the date and time of the last
   modification will be shown.
3. *Likes*: Users can "like" any post, and the total number of "likes" will be
   visible on each post.

*** Other
Additionally, users will have the ability to:

- *Edit their Posts*: Allowing them to correct or update the content of their
  posts.
- *Like Posts*: Interact with other users' posts through the "like" system.

* Conclusion

Zenvi is envisioned as a private, self-hosted social network with a strong focus
on privacy and community control. With these features, it seeks to offer a
differentiated alternative to existing social networks, suitable for small
communities that value privacy and control over their data.
