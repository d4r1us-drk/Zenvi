#+description: The list of adjustments made to the initial idea

- I don't have much time to finish the project, only 3 weeks.
- I must not exceed in functionalities, only include what is absolutely
  necessary for a social network.
- I will focus on cloning Twitter instead of Facebook. Microblogging instead of
  Macroblogging.
- I will allow users to register without the need for administrator
  intervention.
- To simplify the development process, I will not implement video handling in
  the multimedia management of the application.
- Other important functionalities that were missing have been added:
  1. User and post search.
  2. Hashtags.
