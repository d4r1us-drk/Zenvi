#+description: The list of adjustments made to the initial idea

- I don't have much time to finish the project, only 3 weeks.
- I must not exceed in functionalities, only include what is absolutely
  necessary for a social network.
- I will focus on cloning Twitter instead of Facebook. Microblogging instead of
  Macroblogging.
- I will allow users to register without the need for administrator
  intervention.
- To simplify the development process, I will not implement video handling in
  the multimedia management of the application.
- Added user authentication, email confirmation, and single sign-on
  functionality.
- Added other important functionalities that were missing:
  1. User and post search.
  2. Hashtags.
  3. Reporting inappropriate posts.
- Administrators can review and remove inappropriate content or posts.
- Administratos can send a global notice message to all users in the server.
- Administratos can now ban an user for violating policies.
- Post metadata now includes publication date, modification date, likes, and
  comments.
- Chats will include metadata such as message date and sender information.
