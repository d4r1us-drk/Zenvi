#+description: README file for the design documentation folder

This folder's main purpose is to host all the documentation for the design process of the Zenvi project. The following files at this point have been made:

- [[./data-design.org][Data Design]]: The data design document details the data objects and
  relationships in the project, outlining the structure and how various entities
  interact with each other.
- [[./design-language.org][Design Language]]: The design language document specifies the visual and
  interaction design principles, including color schemes, typography, layout
  guidelines, and user interface components to ensure consistency across the
  application.
